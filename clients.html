				<h2>AMS<!-- Association Maintenance Services --></h2>
				<div class="images">
					
				</div>
				<p>Association Maintenance Services provides professional maintenance staff all property  maintenance needs from service repairs to light construction. We made an app that helps property managers submit service requests in a more efficient way. Now, when a property manager sees something that is broken at his property, he can immediately take a picture, record special instructions, and send it to AMS for prompt customer service.</p>

				<p>C2D Technology is developing leading edge deposition technologies for the automotive industry. Their proprietary deposition method allows for fuel efficiency that is far superior than the current leading method.

				<h2>IMGW</h2>
				<div class="images">
					
				</div>
				<p>IMGW is a GIS-based platform to manage risk mapping, security incident tracking, project management and basic service monitoring elements. This tool greatly enhances partners’ capacities for coordinated targeting, design and monitoring of interventions.
				<br>
				We developed this platform using different GIS providers such as Google Maps, Open Street Maps, Ushahidi, among others. <!-- The most important feature is that is capable of peer-to-peer collaboration and sync of data so it can be used on scenarios where internet reliability is an issue. Our client was in Sudan and we were able to have very good communication despite the distance and quick feedback due to a weekly version release approach, which was key for the success of this project. This application is being used by United Nations teams in Sudan and Jordan.</p> -->

				<p>Moneero is a Startup dedicated to bring Bitcoins to the masses through social media, SMS and Bitcoin ATM’s (a.k.a. BTM). They gave us a BTM to use as a test machine and their backend API specifications. We took care of contacting the hardware manufacturers to ask them for API’s to talk to different components, being the most critical one the bill acceptor. <!-- Then we developed the BTM interface and logic and proposed to add several safety features to prevent errors and hacking. --></p>

				<p>Vivalink is developing a low-cost digital tattoo that allows parents to measure their children’s temperatures. We built a mobile monitoring app that allows parents to record their child’s temperature by tapping their phones with the tattoo on their child. Parents can use this to track a child’s progress with an illness over time. The app used NFC to read and record temperature from the tattoo and graph it for the user and was featured at CES.</p>

The Web app uses lots of jQuery and Ajax and the system is currently published on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. We also added a bunch of features to the iOS and Android mobile apps that were created using Corona SDK.</p>
